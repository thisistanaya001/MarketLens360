This growth is driven by the increasing demand from industries such as automotive, construction, and general industrial applications, where primary driers play a crucial role in ensuring proper curing and drying of coatings. Primary driers, also known as surface driers, are extensively used in paints and coatings to accelerate the drying process by enhancing oxidation. The rising trend of eco-friendly and waterborne coatings is further supporting the market's expansion, as these driers are essential in such formulations to improve performance.The market presents significant opportunities in emerging regions like Asia-Pacific and Latin America due to the rapid industrialization and urbanization in these areas. Growing infrastructure projects and the automotive industry's expansion in these regions are expected to fuel the demand for primary driers. Additionally, advancements in drier technologies, with a focus on reducing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and enhancing the efficiency of water-based systems, offer further potential for market growth. As environmental regulations become stricter across various regions, the need for high-performance, low-toxicity driers will continue to drive innovation and adoption, creating a fertile ground for new entrants and existing players to capitalize on the expanding market.</p><p class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of Global Primary Driers Report @ <a href="https://www.verifiedmarketreports.com/download-sample/?rid=343958&amp;utm_source=Github&amp;utm_medium=234" target="_blank">https://www.verifiedmarketreports.com/download-sample/?rid=343958&amp;utm_source=Github&amp;utm_medium=234</a></strong></p><h3 id="" class="">Who are the largest Global manufacturers in the Primary Driers industry?</h3><p><li>Allnex</li><li> Borchers</li><li> DIC Corporation</li><li> Delta Specialties</li><li> Eastman</li><li> K-tech</li><li> Arxada</li><li> Venator Materials</li><li> Goldstab</li><li> Patcham</li><li> Comar Chemicals</li><li> Mobel Advanced Petro Chemical Industry</li><li> Akpa Kimya</li></p><div class=""><div class="" dir="" data-message-author-role="" data-message-id="" data-message-model-slug=""><div class=""><div class=""><div class=""><div class="" dir="" data-message-author-role="" data-message-id="" data-message-model-slug=""><div class=""><div class=""><p>By the year 2030, the scale for growth in the market research industry is reported to be above 120 billion which further indicates its projected compound annual growth rate (CAGR), of more than 5.8% from 2023 to 2030.
